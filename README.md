<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

My first project using React is creating a calculator.  Knowing javascript makes React alot easier to learn.

Reading personal growth and fiction books have been a big part of my life.  Inspired by [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/), jReads is for multiple users to track and discuss books they have read.

The focus is on the backend by putting in place a variety of elements such as:

<ul>
  <li>User authentication</li>
  <li>Managing user comments</li>
  <li>Creating an API to interact with any database API</li>
  <li>Unit testing</li>
  <li>RESTful routes</li>
</ul>

The books and data are initially searched for and found using the Google Books API.  Any books a user adds to their own library are saved to a seperate database for easy reference in the future.
